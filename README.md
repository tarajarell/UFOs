Then, click "Enter" and the filter(s) will apply, while updating the results on the right side of it.

## Summary: Drawbacks & Recommendations
One drawback of this new design is that you only get limited information from the filter searches. While having Date, City, State, Country, Shape, Duration, and Comments is helpful information, it is somewhat lacking. The following two recommendations address this drawback:
1. Provide a link to additional information on the sightings in the Comments area.
2. Provide a link to the Worlde UFO Day mentioned in the opening paragraphs above the data.
